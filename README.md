## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone

# Go into the repository
$ cd

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

To deploy the application in production mode:

```bash
# Build a production build
$ npm run build

# Run the app, deploys to port 3000
$ npm start
```

> **Note**
> Pushing to Github automatically deploys to Vercel if the user is authorized in Vercel, so only push functional versions to main


To deploy develop the application:

```bash
# Run the development version so it reacts to changes, deploys to port 3000
$ npm run dev
```

> **Note**
> Only tested on Windows
